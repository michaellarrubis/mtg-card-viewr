### Background.
Magic: The Gathering, is considered the first trading card game first released in 1993. Two or more players, known in-game as planeswalkers battle it out, by casting spells, summoning creatures, and using artifacts, in order to defeat their opponent. It is estimated that more than 20 million players are actively playing the game as of 2015. We want to capitalize on that chunk of the market, by creating an online marketplace where players can trade in or sell their cards.
